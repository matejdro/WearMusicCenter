Music Center for Wear
================================

Application for customizable music control from Android Wear devices with support for additional watch's buttons and digital crown.

## Installing

App is not on the Play Store anymore, due to Google's constant annoying policies and takedowns without a way to get a good explanation.

You can install the app by manually sideloading the apk from releases to your phone and to your watch. To make watch install easier, you can
use [Wear Installer](https://www.xda-developers.com/wear-installer-sideload-wear-os-apps/).
